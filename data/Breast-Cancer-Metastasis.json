{"extracted_information": "The project aims to perform multi-stage classification of breast cancer metastasis to predict the most likely location of secondary tumors (brain, bone, liver, or lung) based on gene expression data. It processes datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), specifically accession number GSE 14020, which comprises 65 samples from two series matrix Samples (GPL96 and GPL570) with varying dimensions (GPL96: 36 samples, 22,283 genes; GPL570: 29 samples, 54,675 genes). The framework is designed to provide an appropriate prognosis for new data points.", "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["Multi-stage classification of breast cancer metastasis.", "Prediction of secondary tumor location (Brain, Bone, Liver, Lung).", "Utilizes gene expression datasets (GSE 14020).", "Employs various machine learning classification algorithms.", "Integrates Recursive Feature Elimination for feature selection.", "Compares results across different Train/Test Ratios.", "Includes a term paper detailing the problem and solution."], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": ["Dataset: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE14020"], "technologies_used": ["Jupyter Notebook", "Machine Learning Classification Algorithms", "Recursive Feature Elimination", "Python (inferred from Jupyter Notebooks)"], "live_demo_link": "Not found"}
