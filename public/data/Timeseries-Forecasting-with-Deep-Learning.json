{"extracted_information": "This repository focuses on Timeseries Forecasting using various Deep Learning models. The project utilizes a dataset comprising 7-year daily closing prices of major tech stocks: Facebook (META), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG). The dataset is split into 80% for training and 20% for testing. The primary target variable for forecasting is the 'Closing Price'. Model accuracy is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).", "specifications": {"dataset_source": "7-year daily closing price of stock market prices for Facebook (META), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOG)", "data_split": {"train": "80%", "test": "20%"}, "accuracy_metrics": ["RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)", "MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)"], "target_variable": "Closing Price"}, "pricing": {}, "features": ["Implementation of Feed Forward Neural Network", "Implementation of Recurrent Neural Network", "Implementation of Long Short-Term Memory Framework", "Implementation of Gated Recurring Unit Framework", "Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network", "Comparison for Each Model Performance"], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {"dataset_period": "7 years"}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": [], "technologies_used": ["Jupyter Notebook", "Deep Learning Models (Feed Forward Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory Framework, Gated Recurring Unit Framework, Convolutional Neural Network)"], "live_demo_link": null}
