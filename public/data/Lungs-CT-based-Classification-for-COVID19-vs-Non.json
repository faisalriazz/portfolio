{"extracted_information": {"project_description": "This project addresses the challenge of limited publicly available COVID-19 CT datasets for AI-powered diagnosis. It utilizes an open-sourced dataset called COVID-CT, developed by UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which contains 349 COVID-19 CT images (from 216 patients) and 463 non-COVID-19 CTs. The utility of this dataset has been confirmed by a senior radiologist. The dataset's materials, including processed images (CT_COVID.zip, CT_NonCOVID.zip) and meta-information (COVID-CT-MetaInfo.xlsx), were collected from COVID-19 related papers. The primary aim of this project is to perform binary image classification (specifically, 'COVID-vs-NonCOVID') using Transfer Learning techniques and to subsequently optimize the classification results.", "technologies_used": ["Jupyter Notebook (100.0%)"], "key_features": ["Performs binary image classification ('COVID-vs-NonCOVID').", "Utilizes Transfer Learning for image classification.", "Leverages an open-sourced COVID-CT dataset (from UC San Diego and UC Berkeley) for training.", "Aims to optimize classification results."], "live_demo_link": "Not found"}, "specifications": {}, "pricing": {}, "features": [], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": ["https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13865.pdf"]}
