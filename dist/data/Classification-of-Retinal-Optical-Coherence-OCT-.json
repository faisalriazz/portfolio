{"extracted_information": "This project focuses on the classification of Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Its primary objective is to design a system for the identification and classification of OCT Scans from patients suffering from Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), differentiating them from normal patients.
